# Pomodoro-with-Todo-list
This is a Pomodoro Timer with a ToDo List under it. The tasks can be split into groups as needed. The buttons beside the timer are for 25 minute work, 5 minute break, and 10 minute break. Below the user can add tasks for School and Personal Life and check them off, edit them, or delete as needed. Press the start-work button to get a random quote to motivate you through your work session using the quotable api.
